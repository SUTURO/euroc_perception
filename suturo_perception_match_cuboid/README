It will look for planes on the given object, so make sure you pass a segmented, cuboid-formed object
to this program to get proper results.

How to run:
rosrun suturo_perception_match_cuboid match_cuboid my_pcd_file.pcd
You can find some test pcd files in the directory test_data/

The real world dimensions of the test objects are:
